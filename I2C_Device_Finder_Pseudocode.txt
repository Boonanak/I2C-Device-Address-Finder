void setup
	Define variable, error, of byte type
	Define variable, address, of byte type
	init nDevices variable to 0

	Print "Scanning..." to the serial monitor

	For each 'address' starting from 1 to 126 (inclusive):
    		Begin I2C communication with the device at the current 'address'
    		Send a transmission to the I2C device
    		Store the result of the transmission in 'error'

    		IF 'error' is 0 (no error, device found):
        		Print the message "I2C device found at address 0x" to the Serial monitor
        		IF 'address' is less than 16:
           			Print an additional "0" to format the address as a two-character hexadecimal
        			Print the 'address' in hexadecimal format to the Serial monitor
        			Print "!" to the Serial monitor
        			Increment the variable 'nDevices' by 1 (to count the found devices)

	IF no devices were found (nDevices is 0):
    		Print "No I2C devices found\n" to the Serial monitor
	ELSE:
    		Print "done" to the Serial monitor

	Wait for 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds) before the next scan
